# Genetic algorithm
WinForms application to find maximum value of function using genetic algorithm

# Input
[a,b]<- range of solutions  
 d <- accuracy of the result  
N <- size of population  
T <-number of repetitions  
f(x) <- Function we are looking for max output  
Pk <- propablity of crossing  
Pm <- propabilty of mutation  
elita <- trun off/on   elite selection

# Output
Table with result of last repetitions  
Plot of finded function value in each repetitions:  max value, average of finded function values, min value

# Test
Make test to find highly optimal value of: N,T,Pk and Pm.  
Applictation repeat genetic algorithm with diffrend values of: N,T,Pk,Pm and compare the results.
